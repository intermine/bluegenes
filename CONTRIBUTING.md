PRs and Contributions are extremely welcome! The BlueGenes project follows InterMine's contribution guidelines. Please visit http://intermine.org/contributing/ for more details.

## In general, please note:

 - New contributor? Try looking for [issues](https://github.com/intermine/bluegenes/issues) labelled first-timers-only, help wanted, bootcamp, or beginner. We also have a [bootcamp](https://github.com/yochannah/clojure-bootcamp) set of tutorials to help ease you into working with Clojure.
 - All contributions must be substantial. Fixing a typo is acceptable, arbitrarily PRing a whitespace or README format change is not.
 - If you're not sure where to start, visit the [InterMine Contact page](http://intermine.org/contact/) and email, chat, tweet, or join the dev mailing list.


## Picking up new issues - tips

- If you do pick up an issue, we'd recommend commenting on it so we know you're working on it (and we don't start working on it at the same time!).
- CI checks for well-formatted code. Once you've done all of your changes, we recommend running `lein format` in your terminal before you push or make a PR.
- [Developer docs](https://github.com/intermine/bluegenes/tree/dev/docs) are your friend. Please add/update documentation when you make changes to the codebase.
