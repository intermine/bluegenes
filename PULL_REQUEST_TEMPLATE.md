Checked the following pages load results successfully and allow you to proceed to the results or report page:
- [ ] Upload page resolves IDs as expected
- [ ] Templates execute and show results
- [ ] Templates allow you to select lists AND type in identifiers
- [ ] Search (dropdown preview version)
- [ ] Search (full results page)
- [ ] Report page loads, including homologues and tools
- [ ] Region search
- [ ] Login and logout works for more than one user (use test user demo@intermine.org pw demo if needed)

This is not an exhaustive list - if you spot something else strange please bring it up!
